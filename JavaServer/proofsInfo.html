			<h2 class="subtitle">What proofs are and how to use them</h2>
			
			<p>
			Any requests to decrypt any of your data is stored by us in a cryptographic data structure called a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree>Merkel Tree</a>
			where each node is the hash of its children. For any collection of entries in a Merkel Tree, there is one unique value know as the Root Tree Hash(RTH), this value 
			uniquely identifies all the entries in the tree. This structure allows you to check if a certain entry is contained within this data structure by generating proofs.
			 You can use these proofs in your own merkel tree to confirm the same RTH 
			is produced by you as by us.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The current RTH value is kept by a secure device running on an Intel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions">SGX</a> chip. This device is independent
			and publishes its current RTH along with a signature that you can verify. Each proof that is generated allows you to recreate the RTH that is stored by this device, if your 
			calculated value matches that stored by the SGX you can rest easily knowing the data we are providing you with has not been tampered with.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class=subtitle>Proof formating</h2>
			<p>
			Proofs are provided in the format of a JSON object. At the top level there will always have information on the root tree hash the proof has been generated for, and one or more 
			JSON trees. Each node in a JSON tree has either: keys "Left" and "Right" with the values being another node, or the key "Hash" the the value of the hash stored at this node. 
			The exact layout of each proof can be found on their corresponding tab.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class=subtitle>Proof Verifying</h2>
			<p>
			To verify a proof tree you need to ensure that when the value of each node is the the SHA256 hash digest of the left child concatenated with the right. i.e. 
			<code>node = SHA256Hash(node.left || node.right)</code>. Once this has been calculated the value of your root node should match the root given in the JSON file.
			Once you are convinced that the proof matches the RTH given you can check that the RTH given by us as part of the proof is consistent with that of the secure SGX device.
